        <p class="Text">In this book I will try to create a new way of looking at concepts such as good, evil, happiness, wholeness, not to try to create a new model for them but to incentivize the reader to think about those objects in a different manner and to give him tools to work with, this book is more of an mental exercise than anything else, trying to extrapolate ideas and systems, rather than proposing or augmenting in favor of a certain view of world.
In the first chapter I will propose a visualization of truth as an object, to then expand upon it to human evil, good, purpose and thought. Keep in mind that whatever system or metaphors I propose are not something to follow or believe, or even agree, or disagree, for I many times disagree myself with these ideas, it's more about constructing different systems of thought in an attempt to take ourselves from the belief that whatever lies in the deep is inaccessible.
