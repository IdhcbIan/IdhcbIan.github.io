        This is a brief study of truth. Even though we may not yet have the complete truth in our hands, we can still study what it may be and what properties the object of truth possesses. If you are not familiar with the concepts of mathematics or some of the Socratic ways of thinking, you might find it strange to call truth an object. But just hold on, in this book I will develop the ideas of the object of truth,  and soon we will be able to view the object of truth in it of itself.
        <br><br> To understand truth we must first understand the search for truth and the different ways we conventionally search for it, and slowly notice that by changing the mechanism by which we search it, we change the definition of truth, and in turn the object at hand. In this manner this book is also an attempt to unify all those different definitions of truth.

    <h2>What is truth?</h2>
    <p class="Text">   We can understand truth as being the correct answer. In a way when someone tells the truth, he is answering or stating the facts correctly. When you tell your kid to tell the truth, what you mean is that he gives you an accurate description of what happened, not what he wants you to think that happened. 
    </p>  
    <p class="Text">   In this manner the truth is the correct description, the right representation of reality. You can easily see how these concepts apply to simple questions, like “who has the most world cups?” and the correct answer, given the truth about what happened in the previous world cups would be “Brazil!!”. When describing historical events that are not subjective (subjective events: asking if someone or something was beneficial or not to history), then truth can be very straightforward.
    </p>  
    <p class="Text">      Let us expand that concept as truth as the correct description to the realm of science, when we scientists search for the truth we search for the correct description of the material in which we work with, which is nature herself. 
The so longed truth in science would be a theory, who would always explain all things, from the biggest stars, to the smallest particle. This brilliant theory would be able to explain the origins of life, of the universe, and all hard questions we can think of. Also abiding to the law of verification this theory would predict the behavior of any system, in infinitesimal precision.
